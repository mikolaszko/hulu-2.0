# Hulu 2.0

## Description

Hello everyone! This Next.js w/ Tailwind and Lazy Rendering/SSR was done because of the #MernWeekChallenge I've done from 18-22th of July. I wanted to push myself and do 5 full-stack projects, unfortunately I had to skip 1 day so I've finished 4.Projects like these aka the really complex ones are what drives me forward to be an even better software engineer. I am a big fan of these types of UIs where they are are just so simple and elegent yet they are just a joy to they eye.

Demo will be in the about section

### Dependencies

All of them are in the package.json, it's a big built but if you want to check it out there's a link in the about section ^^^

### Executing program

You can just type the piece of code in your terminal at a client folder

```
npm run dev in the hulu-2.0
```
